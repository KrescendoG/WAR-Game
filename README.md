# WAR-Game

Game Logic:
The game consists of a deck of 52 cards which is equally divided between 2 players.
Then at each turn, each player draws one card of a particular value as per their choice and then we'll compare both the card values to determine who's card has the higher value.
The player who has the card with the higher value takes both the cards and add them to his pack of cards.
The name 'WAR' of the game signifies the rounds when both the player draws a card with the same value.
When that happens, it is termed as war, and then each of the players set aside a set of cards, maybe 3 or 5 or whatever each of them feels like along with the card that they both drew in the turn and then they continue their round by drawing another card.
If at that time, they both again drew a card of the same value, they again play war and set aside some cards.
However, if one draws a higher value card then the other one, the winning player takes all the cards set aside by both of them.
When one player runs out of cards to play, he loses.

This game is made using Python programming language and uses Jupyter notebook as its platform.
It involves the use of random library and involves defining different class, namely Player, Card, Deck, and Discard classes.
Each class can be used individually and also as part of the other classes.
(The python notebook file consists of each and every trials for each and every part of the code to understand the game better.)
The last part of the game involves combining all the parts together.
